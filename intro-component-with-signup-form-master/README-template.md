## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say _"[Field Name] cannot be empty"_
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say _"Looks like this is not an email"_

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

### What I learned

### Creating equal width flexbox items

Using flex:1 on a flexbox item, which means that the flex item will grow to fill the available space in its flex container, sharing that space equally with other flex items that also have a value of 1.

### Creating shadow only under button element

To do this, set the spread(4th value) to the negative of blur (3rd value).

```css
.try {
  box-shadow: 0rem 1.5rem 0.5rem -1rem var(--gray-900);
  /* Value meaning (in order of appearance) -horizontal offset,vertical offset, blur, spread, color.
 */
}
```

### Styling button states

Default
Hover
Active (pressed)
Focused

1. Default state
   Full color background
   Clear,readable label

```css
.try {
  box-shadow: 0rem 1.5rem 0.5rem -1rem var(--gray-900);
  /* Adding slight shadow at the bottom for more 3D effect */
}
```

2.  Hover state
    Color darkening or lightening
    Subtle drop shadow or elevation
    Slight size change or border highlight

    I USED BOX SHADOW AROUND BUTTON ON HOVER

```css
.try:hover {
  box-shadow: 0rem 0rem 1.5rem var(--gray-900);
}
```

3.  Active (pressed) state
    Slight "inset" look (button appears pressed in)
    Deeper color tone or shadow compression
    Smaller font size

```css
.try:active {
  transform: scale(0.98);
  background-color: var(--purple-350);
  font-size: 1.3rem;
}
```

4.Focused state
High-contrast outline or glow

```css
.try:focus {
  outline: none;
  box-shadow: 0rem 0rem 0.5rem 0.5rem var(--gray-900);
}
```

### Creating 3D button effect

Adding a very thin highlight inside a button on the bottom horizont.

```css
.claim {
  box-shadow: inset 0rem -0.5rem 0.5rem var(--purple-350);
}
```

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log("ðŸŽ‰");
};
```
